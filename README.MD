# Frontend Test - Meli

Hi ! Wellcome to my Front End test evaluation.

### Structure

The project has two folders, one where the backend is located and the other the front end, they work independently of each other so to start the projects we must navigate to each one and install the necessary dependencies

```
â””â”€â”€ backend
â””â”€â”€ frontend
â””â”€â”€ README.MD
```

### How to try it

- Navigate to the backend (BFF) folder and install

```sh
npm install
```

- Navigate to the frontend folder and install

```sh
yarn
```

Each folder has its specific readme with more instructions

### Thanks ðŸ™Œ
