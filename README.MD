# Frontend Test - Meli

Hi ! Wellcome to my Front End test evaluation.

### Structure

The project has two folders, one where the backend is located and the other the front end, they work independently of each other so to start the projects we must navigate to each one and install the necessary dependencies

```
â””â”€â”€ backend
â””â”€â”€ frontend
â””â”€â”€ README.MD
```

### How to try it locally

- IMPORTANT ! To test the front end you need to start de backend.

- Navigate to the backend (BFF) folder, install and start

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm start
```

- Navigate to the frontend folder, install and start the app

```sh
yarn
```

```sh
yarn start
```

Each folder has its specific readme with more instructions

### Deploy the projects to AWS

The projects are ready to deploy to AWS ! ðŸŒˆ
